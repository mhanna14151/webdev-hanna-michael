Welcome to the README File:

My name is Michael Hanna, and I'm currently a graduate student at Northeastern University.

My experience may sound atypical, largely because it is. After earning my Bachelor's
Degree in Psychology from Carleton College (a liberal arts school in Minnesota) with
a heavy dose of Philosophy to follow, I earned my Master's Degree in Clinical Mental
Health Counseling. Post graduating, I worked in the field for about a year as a Crisis
Clinician, before taking some time off to reevaluate my career. It was meaningful work but
I was ready for a change. 

The program I'm a part of at Northeastern, is the ALIGN program, which is specifically
designed to help students like myself who don't have any (to little) background in
Computer Science, earn a Master's Degree in such.

Thus far I've gotten some experience in a few different languages (C, Java, mySQL,
and Dr. Racket). This Repository is mainly for my Web Development Class, but as I 
continue to practice, I'll expand it to have some of my current and previous work as well.

# AngularFourMEANSeed

After you clone this repository and run "npm install"
To start the project
Open two terminals, One to start the front end, One to start the backend

~ npm start


~ nodemon server.js

Front end will run on `http://localhost:4200/`
Server will run on port 3100. Specified in server.js and in environment.ts files

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
