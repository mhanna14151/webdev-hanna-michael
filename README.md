Welcome to the README File:

My name is Michael Hanna, and I'm currently a graduate student at Northeastern University.

My experience may sound atypical, largely because it is. After earning my Bachelor's
Degree in Psychology from Carleton College (a liberal arts school in Minnesota) with
a heavy dose of Philosophy to follow, I earned my Master's Degree in Clinical Mental
Health Counseling. Post graduating, I worked in the field for about a year as a Crisis
Clinician, before taking some time off to reevaluate my career. It was meaningful work but
I was ready for a change. 

The program I'm a part of at Northeastern, is the ALIGN program, which is specifically
designed to help students like myself who don't have any (to little) background in
Computer Science, earn a Master's Degree in such.

Thus far I've gotten some experience in a few different languages (C, Java, mySQL,
and Dr. Racket). This Repository is mainly for my Web Development Class, but as I 
continue to practice, I'll expand it to have some of my current and previous work as well.
